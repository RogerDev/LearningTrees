/**
  * Export a Learning Forest model to LUCI format
  *
  * LUCI is a LexisNexis proprietary mechanism for describing a model that can then
  * be efficiently processed within an LN product.
  *
  * Note the following restrictions:
  * 1) Regression Forest Only.  Classification Forests cannot be handle by LUCI at this
  *    time because there is no support for aggregation by vote (mode).
  * 2) This module produces a LUCI file that outputs the exact same Regression values
  *    as the Regression Forest model.  LUCI allows some additional features that are
  *    beyond the scope of this module.
  *    If these features are needed, the resultant LUCI file may need to be hand edited
  *    to achieve those results.  Examples of these features include:
  *    - Defining Reason Code logic (L1MD record)
  *    - Setting minimum and maximum bounds (L2FO record)
  *    - Adding an increment value to the final results (L2FO)
  *    - Setting a scaling formula to scale the final results (L2FO)
  *    - Excluding certain input records (L1EX record)
  *    - See the LUCI documentation for more info:
  *          https://gitlab.ins.risk.regn.net/HIPIE/HIPIE_Plugins/wikis/LUCIfiles#l2se
  * This module supports the following LUCI use cases:
  * 1)  Single work-item / single scorecard.
  * 2)  Work-items and corresponding scorecards represent training of different response
  *     variables on (potentially) different subsets of the features in the LUCI input layout.
  * 3)  Work-items and corresponding scorecards represent training of the same response variable
  *     across subsets of the input data (e.g. one per country).  It is anticipated, though not
  *     required, that the same subset of LUCI input layout features was used for training each subset.

  * Export a LUCI model
  *
  * Create a LUCI model based on a model as returned from
  * RegressionForest.GetModel, as well as additional information provided
  * within this interface.
  * The following types of LUCI record are created:
  * - A single L1MD record
  * - One L2FO record per LUCI scorecard
  * - One L2SE record per scorecard that includes a filter expression
  * - One L3TN record per node for each tree in each forest (i.e. work-item).
  * Note that scorecards in LUCI correspond to work-items in LearningForest.
  *
  * @param mod The random forest model as returned from GetModel
  * @param model_name The name of the LUCI model (see LUCI L1MD definition)
  * @param model_id The id of the LUCI model (see LUCI L1MD definition)
  * @param scorecards DATASET(LT_Types.LUCI_Scorecard) describing each
  *                   work-item in the model that will be exported as
  *                   a LUCI scorecard.
  * @return DATASET(LUCI_Rec) representing the lines of a LUCI .csv file.
  *         The caller is responsible for melding the lines into an actual
  *         .csv file and storing it in a given location.
